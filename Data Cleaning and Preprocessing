This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a raw sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The objective is to make the data consistent, reliable, and ready for analysis by removing errors, filling gaps, and formatting fields properly.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

CSV format (from Kaggle sample sales dataset)

âœ… Cleaning Tasks Performed
Removed Duplicates

Used Excelâ€™s built-in Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate redundant rows.

Handled Missing Values

Replaced missing entries in:

STATE, TERRITORY â†’ 'Unknown'

POSTALCODE â†’ '00000'

ADDRESSLINE2 â†’ blank ("")

Standardized Text Fields

Applied LOWER(), PROPER(), and TRIM() to clean:

COUNTRY, STATUS, DEALSIZE

Formatted Dates

Converted ORDERDATE into a consistent dd-mm-yyyy format for Excel compatibility.

Renamed Column Headers

Changed to lowercase and used underscores (e.g., Customer Name â†’ customer_name) for consistency.

Fixed Data Types

Ensured quantityordered and orderlinenumber are integers, and price/sales values are decimal.
